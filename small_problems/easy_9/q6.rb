# Sequence Count
# Create a method that takes two integers as arguments. The first argument is a
# count, and the second is the first number of a sequence that your method will 
# create. The method should return an Array that contains the same number of 
# elements as the count argument, while the values of each element will be 
# multiples of the starting number.

# You may assume that the count argument will always have a value of 0 or 
# greater, while the starting number can be any integer value. If the count is 
# 0, an empty list should be returned.
