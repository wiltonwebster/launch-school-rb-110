# Fibonacci Numbers (Recursion)

# The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers starting with 1 and 1 where each
# number is the sum of the two previous numbers: the 3rd Fibonacci number is 
# 1 + 1 = 2, the 4th is 1 + 2 = 3, the 5th is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on.


# Sequences like this translate naturally as "recursive" methods. A recursive 
# method is one in which the method calls itself. For example:

def sum(n)
  return 1 if n == 1
  n + sum(n - 1)
end

# sum is a recursive method that computes the sum of all integers between 1 and 
# n.

# Recursive methods have three primary qualities:

# They call themselves at least once.
# They have a condition that stops the recursion (n == 1 above).
# They use the result returned by themselves.

# In the code above, sum calls itself once; it uses a condition of n == 1 to 
# stop recursing; and, n + sum(n - 1) uses the return value of the recursive 
# call to compute a new return value.

# Write a recursive method that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is
# an argument to the method.

def fibonacci(n)
  return 0 if n < 1
  return 1 if n == 1 || n == 2
  fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
end
